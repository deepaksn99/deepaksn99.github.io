Hello! I am Deepak, an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar. I am interested in pursuing a career in research and will be applying to graduate programs beginning Fall 2020. As an undergraduate, I am very fortunate to have worked with Professors [Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/), [Mani Chandy](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/mani) and [Anirban Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/site/anirbandasgupta/). 

Link to my research [here](./research.md).




## Research 
I have diverse research interests - I am interested in theoretical computer science concerning data, as well as interested in machine learning applied to societal problems. 

I have done multiple research projects and a few of them are outlined below.

### Scalable Estimation of Air Quality using Multi-Modal Data

*   Our project is aimed mainly towards employing machine learning techniques to estimate fine spatial and temporal resolution PM2.5\. We also aim to employ machine learning techniques to solve the problem of cost-effective air quality monitoring by air quality station location recommendation. 

### A study of the K-Shell Decomposition in Social Networks

*   The main aim of this project is to be able to come up with novel local search based techniques to estimate the shell index in a network and also to be able to solve the problem of finding the most influential node in a social network in an efficient manner.
*   This is a research project that I am currently working on, continuing from my internship at the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, under [Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar](http://sudarshaniyengar.com/).
* Our work is under review!

### Other Projects

* I have also contributed to Open Source and am a listed contributor at [ptop](https://github.com/darxtrix/ptop). 
* Various other mini projects that I have done have been open-sourced at my GitHub account linked below. 

## Blogs

I have written two blogs so far! I blog on material that I find cool and useful.
